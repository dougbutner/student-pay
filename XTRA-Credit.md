# XTRA Credit


## Purpose

Give students a reason to learn more with XTRA Credit. 

## How it works

Pull in data from outside sources and incorporate it into your rewards structure. Sky is the limit, any API can be called to get information that you can incorporate into extra credit: sports scores, weather, other class's progress (for competitions). 

Talk to your school's tech guru about the available APIs you may be able to use to get student's performance information.

You can use the [existing API endpoints available from Learndash](https://developers.learndash.com/rest-api/v2/) to extend right out of the box.

## Learndash Endpoints to Try 

**Lessons**

You can add new lessons at certain intervals to track when students took a course, and update courses. Experiment with using APIs to update the data in your courses, and to give XTRA Credit to those who revisit past courses.

**Essays** 

Incentivize students to write well (and check for plagrism) by incorporating checks and rewards on long-text responses.
