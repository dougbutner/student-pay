# Metabuild Hackathon Completion status Notes üìù
I want to be clear about the completion status of this project. The frontend is working as stated in the project. All of the information is being stored in the way we need to query it.  This project is not working on the backend. This project structure is, I believe, sane and the backend will work for anyone who gets past the compiler errors related to syntax and ESM paradigms.


# Explanation on backend status üì¶

  I am using bree successfully in production for another project, but for this hackathon I introduced complexity of copying the paradigms I saw NEAR programmers using, namely using import instead of require, and trying to use Promise.all() instead of the async/await syntax I am more familiar with. While I learned a lot, I was not able to rectify all errors in time to get back to the meaningful development.


# Examining simple fixes üõ†

I looked into using an existing Github codebase with a frontend and wp-json authenticator to make the UI and connection all in one. All of the handful of repos I tried had multiple high-severity vulnerabilities, and I felt much better about my low-dependency solution. 

In conclusion, I decided not to fork any other repos, but instead continue here. 

**I am currently working full-time on [Aquarius Academy](https://aquarius.academy) and [cXc](https://cxc.world), and have put development of this repo on the back-burner.**

I encourage any developers to use the skeleton here to implement a working solution. 

# Finishing the Repo
Whether or not I win any prizes, this concept is coming to Aquarius.Academy and other schools like Tetra.Earth, where it is already running. We want to build on NEAR because of the ease of smart contract development. The funding we receive as prize money will not only to fund development of the full solution and integration, but help us launch the product(s) as an accreditation within the NEAR community.
